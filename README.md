## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Competition is always a factor when it comes to companies. Large corporations like Microsoft and Google offer no-code platforms, while smaller companies can quickly and cheaply launch innovative products. A major financial challenge was acquired in May 2022, when US jury ordered Pegasystems to pay $2.036 billion to Appian, a low-code workflow rival. In May 2022, a Virginia state jury awarded $2.036 billion in damages to Appian Corporation from Pegasystems Inc. for allegedly stealing its trade secrets. The lawsuit claimed that Pegasystems and its CEO, Alan Trefler, violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by assuring investors that Appian's trade secrets case was "without merit." Following this disclosure, shares of Pegasystems common stock fell $13.68 per share, or over 20% in value, to close on May 10, 2023 at a price of $52.25 per share.

Pegasystems provides enterprise software solutions to help businesses solve problems and transform. Pega's website says their software is designed to help businesses. They maximize customer lifetime value, streamline service, raise efficiency, and make better decisions.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) "Pega Systems is a software development company that uses Java, OOP, and Java ideas to build its low-code app development tools. Pega's products are built on Java and provide Java code that is executed at runtime." (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-pega-technology-so-hyped-up-many-leading-brands-using-chauhan/)

## Landscape

Pegasystems, a software company that uses AI to service fields such as financial services, insurance, healthcare, government, manufacturing, and high tech.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
For instance, a 2020 NCBI study found that AI-based algorithms accurately detected 68% of COVID-19-positive cases in a dataset of 25 patients initially diagnosed as negative by healthcare professionals. The implementation of AI and ML technologies aims to enhance patient care, reduce machine downtime, and lower care expenses, driving market growth. The pandemic has further accelerated the adoption of AI-based technologies, particularly in diagnostics, patient and medication management, claims processing, workflow optimization, machine integration, and cybersecurity within healthcare settings.(https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-market?utm_source=g_ad_hc&utm_campaign=ai_in_healthcare_market&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3ZayBhDRARIsAPWzx8oVHIcEJZEDUCMW3yD_PhJvUJeMHL7lqv6YRnOXM2KRkb-rmH1T9WgaAjK3EALw_wcB)

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) According to Yahoo Finance, Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) stock has increased due to strong revenue growth, which has been driven by demand for AI products and outperformance in the subscription license segment. In February 2024, Pegasystems' revenue grew 20% to $474.2 million, which was higher than the consensus estimate of $413.6 million. The company's annual contract value (ACV) also increased 11% year-over-year, which indicates a strong commitment from customers.(https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-pegasystems-pega-stock-soaring-180211807.html). With this being seen, I would advise the company to strengthen its resources in AI development. Taking on more starter companies to ensure more dollars in. Accounting for loss, it would pay out to have large influence in smaller companies to implement new ideas and strategies without taking a loss to the company itself. Utilizing positive results in the main company itself would help continue the companies gain in net worth and stock value.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Stated before I believe utilizing smaller companies would help with the loss to the main company and have positive real world data to use for the pega company

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Having multiple systems help other customers in different fields would help Pega utilize their strength in customer service and grow their customer reach

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Being able to test new strategies would help Pega grow in its business reach. Could even have a AI system to collect and keeep track of data that is working and appliable to their system.
